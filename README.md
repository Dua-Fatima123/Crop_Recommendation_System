# Crop_Recommendation_System
I developed a Crop Recommendation System using Deep Learning and deployed it with a clean and interactive Streamlit web app.
🌾 This system takes soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall as input, and recommends the most suitable crop for cultivation in a given region.

🔧Tools & Tech Used:

Python 🐍

TensorFlow / Keras

Pandas, NumPy

Streamlit

Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)

🎯 Goal: To assist farmers and agricultural experts in making data-driven decisions to increase productivity and sustainability.

💡 It was an amazing hands-on experience applying AI to solve real-world problems. Looking forward to more impactful AI projects ahead!
